    "text": "Thanks for the warm welcome, but why am I learning R?\nWhile there are many excellent “click-and-point” statistical analysis packages available, it’s worth highlighting some of the benefits that come with using R (Markdown):\n\nYou can record and document all analysis steps (i.e., from raw data processing/wrangling, to inferential statistics and visualization) in a series of scripts, meaning that you don’t have to remember which sequence of buttons and drop down menus you followed to get to your analysis outputs. This facilitates complete reproducibility of your analysis pipeline and results.\nWriting your research papers and assignments with R Markdown means that all analysis outputs (e.g., descriptive statistics, test statistics, figures, tables, etc.) can be embedded without the need for pasting information from your statistics software into a separate word processor.\nYou gain more power to customize your analysis, rather than relying on the narrow range of defaults included in some statistical packages.\nIt’s free!",

    "text": "1.2 Getting started with Projects and Files\n\n1.2.1 Creating a new R Project\nR Studio provides an environment where you can use R Markdown to create documents with embedded analysis outputs, and store these in self-contained project folders which will ensure that your analyses can easily be reproduced without having to change directory names when you switch computers. (See this link for more on the utility of using R projects.)\nTo open a new R project, click File &gt; NewProject. The ‘New Project Wizard’ will pop up, prompting you to specify where you would like to create your project. For now, the best choice would be one of the following:\n\nNew Directory. Create a completely new folder in which to base your project.\n\nExisting Directory. Name an already existing folder as your project base.\n\nAfter you have chosen your project folder, a project link will appear in that folder, which looks like this:\n\nClicking on it outside of R will open up a new R Studio session with your designated project folder as its starting directory. You can now move all data necessary for your project to this folder, where it can be easily found by R.\n\n\n1.2.2 Creating a new R Markdown document\nTo open a new R Markdown document within R Studio, click File &gt; NewFile &gt; R Markdown and you will see a prompt which asks for a Title, Author and Date. You can leave these blank initially, safe in the knowledge that these fields can always be updated later. Likewise, you can always modify the document output format later, but you do need to initially select something under ‘Default Output Format’ to allow R to create your Markdown file. The document type will depend on the assignment, course, and your teacher’s preferences. For your assignments for ISA, .html will be fine, but for other assignment (e.g., your final thesis), you should switch the output to either PDF (which requires installation of an extra package2 or Word.\nAn editor window will spring open with a new, as yet untitled, .Rmd file. Before going further, you should save this (Ctrl/Cmd + S) with a sensible name3. At the top of the document, you will see the YAML header where settings for document output can be added or modified.",

    "text": "1.2 Writing in R Markdown\nR Markdown is an extremely rich and powerful tool and you can browse the definitive guide from one of the main authors of the package to help you get the most out of it. For the most part, you can use it as you would any other typesetting/word-processing tool, with the advantage that you can directly embed analysis code and results. We will only briefly discuss some essential features, but we will return to this topic in later sections.\n\n1.2.1 Creating a new R Markdown document\nTo open a new R Markdown document within R Studio, click File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown and you will see a prompt which asks for a Title, Author and Date. You can leave these blank initially, safe in the knowledge that these fields can always be updated later. Likewise, you can always modify the document output format later, but you do need to initially select something under ‘Default Output Format’ to allow R to create your Markdown file.

For your assignments for ISA, .html will be fine, but for other assignment (e.g., your final thesis), you should switch the output to either PDF (which requires installation of an extra package2 or Word.\nA fresh .Rmd file will open in the editor window. At the top of the document, you will see the YAML header where settings for document output can be added or modified.\n\n\n1.2.2 New lines\nBeginning a new line works in exactly the same way as with any other word processor. Simply hit Enter/Return and carry on typing.\n\n\n1.2.3 Headings\nHeadings are created with the hash key (#) and the number of hashes modifies the heading level. R Markdown has six levels:\n\n# Huge\n## Big\n### Not so big\n#### Small\n##### Very small\n###### Tiny\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Lists\nLists with multiple levels of indentation can be created with numbers, letters, and symbols:\n\n1. Number 1\n    a. 1a\n        + 1aplus\n2. Number 2\n\nThe above code appears as:\n\nNumber 1\n\n1a\n\n1aplus\n\n\nNumber 2\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Equations\nEquations can be nicely formatted in one of two ways:\n\nFirstly, this is the inline method which produces: $E = mc^2$\n\nFirstly, this is the inline method which produces: \\(E = mc^2\\)\n\nAlternatively, you can ident equations:\n$$\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}\n$$\n\nAlternatively, you can indent equations:\n\\[\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\]\n\n\n1.2.6 Code chunks\nCode chunks are used to tell R to perform operations (e.g., load packages or data, do some analysis, etc.) within the document. They look like this:\n\n{r chunkTitle, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}\n\n  DoSomething&lt;-'OK' # create a variable ('character' vector)\n    \n  print(DoSomething) # print the contents of that variable\n    \n  # I set 'eval' to 'FALSE', meaning that these commands will be printed, but not actually run.\n\nIn R Markdown documents, you can execute the embedded R code chunk-by-chunk, which will create output in your R (Studio) terminal and/or workspace. This is useful for debugging purposes, as ‘knitting’ the document - which we discuss later - will execute the code ‘silently’, and as a whole, meaning that interim outputs will not be written to your workspace and only the final product (i.e., your full document) will be generated.\nWhether the reader sees code chunks or not in your final output document depends on whether the echo parameter inside the curly braces is set to ‘TRUE’ (‘show’ - the default) or ‘FALSE’ (‘don’t show’). For writing documents like your thesis, you will likely want much of the code to be suppressed in the PDF/Word version, and readers interested in viewing the code and reproducing your findings can view and execute an .Rmd version of the document in which you do your coding and writing. New code chunks can be created by pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I. Chunk parameters are contained inside curly braces and the first argument inside the braces is simply ‘r’; to give a chunk a title, you leave a space - but NOT a comma. To start adding ‘TRUE’/‘FALSE’ values for chunk parameters, you type a comma after the ‘r chunkTitle’ arguments, and then separate each subsequent chunk parameter/value pair with more commas\n\n\n1.2.7 Inline code\nInline code is useful for printing values deriving from your analysis directly into your document, thereby minimizing errors which might arise from manual entry or copy-paste. Let’s first create some variables:\n\nChipWeekend&lt;-'Salt and Vinegar'\nChipWeek&lt;-'Paprika'\n\nWe can then call the contents of these variables and weave them into the main body of our document by opening backticks and inserting the variable we want to call after r:\n\nOn Tuesdays, I buy `r ChipWeek` chips, but on Saturdays I get `r ChipWeekend`.\n\nWhen executed, the above appears in your document as:\n\nOn Tuesdays, I buy Paprika chips, but on Saturdays I get Salt and Vinegar.",

    "section": "2.2 Working with data",
    "text": "2.2 Working with data\nThe dplyr sub-package from tidyverse includes an abridged version of the “Starwars characters” dataset, which we will use here. Datasets loaded with packages do not generally need to be declared as variables in an R session, but we will do this now for consistency with the workflow you will later follow. To create an object in your R environment, you follow the form: name_of_my_object &lt;- stuff_to_go_into_my_object. The &lt;- is R’s assignment operator, which you use to tell it to assign values (be they text, numbers, matrices, dataframes, etc.) to an object name.\n\nmy_starwars&lt;-dplyr::starwars\n\nThis creates an R object named my_starwars which is of the “dataframe” class. We don’t need to discuss this further, other than to say that it is a tabular class (i.e., like .csv, .xls, and the like) where rows represent observations and columns represent variables. In this example, the rows correspond to different characters, whereas the columns hold values for each character across a range of characteristics.\n\n2.2.1 Taking a glimpse…\nNow that we have created our object, we can take a peek:\n\ndplyr::glimpse(my_starwars)\n\nRows: 87\nColumns: 14\n$ name       &lt;chr&gt; \"Luke Skywalker\", \"C-3PO\", \"R2-D2\", \"Darth Vader\", \"Leia Or…\n$ height     &lt;int&gt; 172, 167, 96, 202, 150, 178, 165, 97, 183, 182, 188, 180, 2…\n$ mass       &lt;dbl&gt; 77.0, 75.0, 32.0, 136.0, 49.0, 120.0, 75.0, 32.0, 84.0, 77.…\n$ hair_color &lt;chr&gt; \"blond\", NA, NA, \"none\", \"brown\", \"brown, grey\", \"brown\", N…\n$ skin_color &lt;chr&gt; \"fair\", \"gold\", \"white, blue\", \"white\", \"light\", \"light\", \"…\n$ eye_color  &lt;chr&gt; \"blue\", \"yellow\", \"red\", \"yellow\", \"brown\", \"blue\", \"blue\",…\n$ birth_year &lt;dbl&gt; 19.0, 112.0, 33.0, 41.9, 19.0, 52.0, 47.0, NA, 24.0, 57.0, …\n$ sex        &lt;chr&gt; \"male\", \"none\", \"none\", \"male\", \"female\", \"male\", \"female\",…\n$ gender     &lt;chr&gt; \"masculine\", \"masculine\", \"masculine\", \"masculine\", \"femini…\n$ homeworld  &lt;chr&gt; \"Tatooine\", \"Tatooine\", \"Naboo\", \"Tatooine\", \"Alderaan\", \"T…\n$ species    &lt;chr&gt; \"Human\", \"Droid\", \"Droid\", \"Human\", \"Human\", \"Human\", \"Huma…\n$ films      &lt;list&gt; &lt;\"A New Hope\", \"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Return of the J…\n$ vehicles   &lt;list&gt; &lt;\"Snowspeeder\", \"Imperial Speeder Bike\"&gt;, &lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;, \"Imp…\n$ starships  &lt;list&gt; &lt;\"X-wing\", \"Imperial shuttle\"&gt;, &lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;, \"TIE Advanced x1\",…\n\n\nThe dplyr::glimpse function shows the total number of rows (i.e., the number of characters) in the dataframe, the total number of column variables, and the name of all column variables (these are displayed - somewhat confusingly - as rows with a $ prefix). As you should see, this dataset includes 87 characters with values on 14 variables.\n\n\n2.2.2 filtering on values of a specific variable, and pulling only the variable of interest\nSay that we wanted to quickly find out how old Yoda is. We can filter on his name to isolate his row in the dataframe, and then drop all other variables apart from his age1 from our dataset:\n\nyoda_age &lt;- my_starwars %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(name == \"Yoda\") %&gt;% \n  dplyr::pull(birth_year)\n\nReveal to us, this does, that Yoda 896 years old is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 2.1: Using the “pipe” operator (%&gt;%)\n\n\n\nBefore going further, we must discuss the use of the so-called pipe (%&gt;%) above. This allows you to chain different functions together without having to call the object you want to manipulate for every function. Let’s break down the above chunk line-by-line:\n\nYoda_age &lt;- my_starwars %&gt;% - this copies my_starwars to a new object named yoda_age, and %&gt;% passes yoda_age onto the next operation.\ndplyr::filter(name == \"Yoda\") %&gt;% - this feeds yoda_age into the function dplyr::filter, which then searches the variable name for the text string “Yoda”, and discards characters with names which are not Yoda. As before, the %&gt;% moves the output along to the next line of code.\ndplyr::pull(age) - this “pulls” out the age column variable for Yoda and throws everything else away, leaving us with a value of 896 stored inside yoda_age.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 mutate-ing your data frame\nLet’s imagine that we want to calculate every character’s body mass index (BMI) of every listed character and add this value to their row in the dataframe. The mutate function allows us to easily create new variables, or edit existing ones.\nWe define BMI as:\n\\[\nBMI = \\frac{weight(kg)}{height(m)^2}\n\\]\nSo, to calculate this value, we need to use the height (measured in cm) and mass (in kg) fields.\n\nmy_starwars &lt;- my_starwars %&gt;% \n  dplyr::mutate(BMI = mass/(height/100)^2)\n\nAs above, we use the pipe to pass my_starwars on to mutate. We create the variable BMI inside the call to mutate, and then perform our calculations.\nTo check the operation performed correctly, you can just call up the new variable.\n\nmy_starwars$BMI\n\n [1]  26.02758  26.89232  34.72222  33.33007  21.77778  37.87401  27.54821\n [8]  34.00999  25.08286  23.24598  23.76641        NA  21.54509  24.69136\n[15]  24.72518 443.42857  26.64360  33.95062  39.02663  25.95156  23.35095\n[22]  35.00000  31.30194  25.21625  25.79592  25.61728        NA        NA\n[29]  25.82645  26.56250  23.89326  24.67038        NA  13.14828  17.18034\n[36]  16.34247        NA        NA        NA  31.88776        NA        NA\n[43]  26.12245        NA  17.35892  24.03461  50.92802        NA  24.46460\n[50]  23.76641  20.91623  22.64681        NA  14.76843        NA        NA\n[57]  22.63468        NA  24.83565        NA        NA  23.88844  19.44637\n[64]  18.14487        NA  21.47709        NA  23.58984  19.48696  26.01775\n[71]  16.78076        NA        NA        NA  12.88625        NA  17.99015\n[78]  34.07922  24.83746  22.35174  15.14960  18.85192        NA        NA\n[85]        NA        NA        NA\n\n\n(In general, you can index an existing column variable in a dataframe and display it simply by typing name_of_dataframe$name_of_column into the R console.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 2.2: What does NA mean?\n\n\n\nIn the BMI printout above, you will see values of NA which means that there is no value available for that character.

Histograms create ranged bins for the frequency variable (here height) and the height of the bars indicates how many observations fall into a particular bin. Density plots show a smoothed version of the same data, making them particularly informative for continuous data.\n\n\n3.3.2 Barcharts\n\ndplyr::starwars %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(gender) & !is.na(height)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::group_by(gender) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::summarize(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = T), se_height = sd(height, na.rm = T)/sqrt(n())) %&gt;% \n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = mean_height, fill = gender))+\n  ggplot2::geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", width = .75) +\n  ggplot2::geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_height - se_height, ymax = mean_height + se_height),width = .5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Barchart of mean height by character gender. Error bars represent +/- 1 SE\n\n\n\n\n\nBarcharts show a summary statistic (typically - and in this case - the mean) and should include error or confidence bars around the statistic as an estimate of uncertainty.\nYou will notice the code above contains some extra steps compared to some of the other plots shown:\n\ndplyr::filter(!is.na(gender) & !is.na(height)) - we discussed NA values in Note 2.2; we use dplyr::filter to remove characters who have a value of NA for either gender or height (i.e., by saying: “keep only characters who do NOT have a value of NA for both gender and height”). In this way, we save only characters with complete information on the variables of interest.\n\ndplyr::group_by(gender) - we tell dplyr to group characters by the levels of gender in the dataset. On its own, this has no apparent effect on the dataset, but it provides instructions for how subsequent operations should be performed.\ndplyr::summarize(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = T), se_height = sd(height, na.rm = T)/sqrt(n())) - the dplyr::summarize function reduces a dataset to a requested set of summary statistics. This is where group_by comes into play - because we grouped by gender, summary statistics will now be created per gender grouping. Inside summarize, we declare the new variables mean_height (which gives mean height) and se_height (standard error for height) which will be passed on to create the barchart.\nggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = mean_height, fill = gender)) - creates an empty plot, sets gender as the x variable, and the newly-created mean_height variable as the y variable.\nggplot2::geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") - this creates the barchart based on the aesthetics previously supplied. The stat = \"identity\" call simply tells ggplot2 to create the plot based on the values as they are, without further summarizing or processing.\nggplot2::geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_height - se_height, ymax = mean_height + se_height),width = .5) - this draws our errorbars, based on values of mean +/- one standard error. The width argument sets the width of the horizontal “handles”\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Boxplots\n\ndplyr::starwars %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(gender) & !is.na(height)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = height, fill = gender), na.rm = FALSE)+\n  ggplot2::geom_boxplot(width = .4) +\n  ggplot2::geom_label(data = boxlabels, aes(x = horz, y = height, label = labels),inherit.aes = FALSE, size = 2.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Boxplot of height by character gender.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots visualize the five-figure summary of a dataset (more on this in ISA), and provide a more informative means of comparing groups than barplots.\n\n\n3.3.4 Violinplots\n\ndplyr::starwars %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(gender) & !is.na(height)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = height, fill = gender), na.rm = FALSE)+\n  ggplot2::geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Violinplot of height by character gender.\n\n\n\n\n\nViolinplots are mirrored-density plots which can sometimes slightly resemble violins. The wider the plot, the greater the number of observations that cluster around particular values of the variable of interest (height). As with boxplots, you gain more information with these than with a barplot, as the full range of the data is shown, along with the density.",

    "text": "5.5 Measures of central tendency\nIn this course, we will consider three measures of central tendency.\n\n5.5.1 The arithmetic mean\nThis is usually represented by one of two formulae:\n\n\\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n}x_i\\)\n\\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_i}{n}\\)\n\nStraightforwardly: sum all scores and divide by the total number of scores. In R, the arithmetic mean is given by the mean function:\n\nmean(students$age)\n\n[1] 18.75\n\n\nStrictly speaking, the mean can only be sensibly calculated for interval/ratio level data.\n\n\n5.5.2 The median\nThis is the 50th percentile in the dataset (i.e., it divides the data into a lower half and an upper half). It is obtained by ranking scores and finding the value which divides the dataset in two.\nFor data \\(x\\) with \\(n\\) elements:\n\nif \\(n\\) is odd, \\(med(x) = x_{(n+1)/2}\\)\nif \\(n\\) is even, \\(med(x) = \\frac{x_{(n/2)} + x_{((n/2)+1)}}{2}\\)\n\nFor example, in a sorted dataset with 11 values, the median will be the value at the observation ranked 6th. However, in a sorted dataset with 12 values, the median will be the arithmetic mean of the values ranked in 6th and 7th. In R, we can simply use median:\n\nmedian(students$age)\n\n[1] 18.5\n\n\nThe median can be used to summarize both interval/ratio and ordinal variables.\n\n\n5.5.3 The mode\nLastly, we turn to the mode, which is simply the most frequently occurring value. At the time of writing, base R doesn’t have a function to compute the mode, so let’s write one ourselves:\n\n#Hat-tip to #https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-language/convert-factor-to-numeric-and-numeric-to-factor-in-r-programming/ for the facto-to-numeric conversion \n\ncusmode&lt;-function(x){\n  xf&lt;-as.data.frame(table(x))\n  modeframe&lt;-xf[xf$Freq == max(xf$Freq),]\n  names(modeframe)[1]&lt;-\"Mode(s)\"\n  modeframe$`Mode(s)`&lt;-as.numeric(as.character(modeframe$`Mode(s)`)) \n  names(modeframe)[2]&lt;-\"Frequency\"\n  return(modeframe)\n}\n\ncusmode(students$age)\n\n  Mode(s) Frequency\n1      18         2\n\n\nDatasets can have multiple modes; for example, let’s imagine a new student joins the party:\n\nstudents[5,]&lt;-c(\"Billy\",20)\n\ncusmode(students$age)\n\n  Mode(s) Frequency\n1      18         2\n3      20         2\n\n\nThe mode can be calculated for all measurement levels about which you have learned, but it is typically most informative when there are relatively few values which the data can take.",

    "text": "5.8 Selecting subsets\nSay we are interested only in the age of respondents from the Netherlands. Using the dplyr::filter function, we can pick those out and then summarize the agea variable. A useful feature of the .sav version of the ESS dataset is the variable labelling. If you enter ESS$cntry into the console, you get a list of the numeric values which code for different countries, but also a list of what those numeric values represent, at the bottom of the console output. However, we will ask haven to print only the labels for convenience.\n\nhaven::print_labels(ESS$cntry)\n\n\nLabels:\n value          label\n     1        Austria\n     2        Belgium\n     3    Switzerland\n     4         Cyprus\n     5        Germany\n     6          Spain\n     7        Finland\n     8         France\n     9 United Kingdom\n    10         Greece\n    11        Croatia\n    12        Hungary\n    13        Ireland\n    14        Iceland\n    15          Italy\n    16      Lithuania\n    17    Netherlands\n    18         Norway\n    19         Poland\n    20       Portugal\n    21         Serbia\n    22         Sweden\n    23       Slovenia\n    24       Slovakia\n\n\nWe can see that the Netherlands is represented by the value 17 in the dataset. We could now filter on this number, but it might be more informative if the variable value was the same as variable label. Thankfully, the haven package which we used for the data import makes this easily achievable:\n\n1ESS &lt;- ESS %&gt;%\n2  dplyr::mutate(cntry_text = haven::as_factor(cntry))\n\n\n1\n\nReassign ESS so that the operations will be saved to the dataframe.\n\n2\n\nUse dplyr::mutate to create the new variable (as it is good practice NOT to write over existing variables) and haven::as_factor(cntry) to assign the text label of cntry to each participant, instead of the numerical value.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can filter in a more transparent manner:\n\n1ESS_NL&lt;-ESS %&gt;%\n2  dplyr::filter(cntry_text == \"Netherlands\")\n\n\n1\n\nTake ESS\n\n2\n\nUse dplyr::filter to select only participants from the Netherlands. cntry_text == \"Netherlands\" asks the function to return only participants with a value on the variable cntry_text which is equal to “Netherlands”. Note the use of the == instead of =.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 5.1: Use of logical operators when subsetting or selecting\n\n\n\nYou will probably rely mostly on the following:\n\n== - searches for perfect matches, as in the example above.\n!= - the complement of ==. E.g, dplyr::filter(cntry_text != \"Netherlands\") means “give me all respondents who are NOT from the Netherlands”.\n& - used when you want the selected responses to satisfy multiple conditions. E.g., dplyr::filter(cntry_text == \"Netherlands\" & agea &gt; 22) means “give me all respondents from the Netherlands who are also older than (&gt; = ”greater than”) 22”.\n| - OR selection. Use this if you want to select responses which match at least one of the specified conditions. E.g., dplyr::filter(cntry_text == \"Netherlands\" | agea &gt; 22) will return participants who are either in the Netherlands, or older than 22, or both. Participants who meet neither criterion will be filtered out.\n\n\n\nNow that we have extracted Dutch respondents’ data, we can run create frequency tables and summary lists as previously.\n\ntable(ESS_NL$agea)\n\n\n15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 \n 4 26 21 21 24 25 17 16 21 22 19 20 18 18 15 11 22 26 35 19 29 22 19 29 22 28 \n41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 \n29 28 30 22 15 26 18 23 35 29 32 38 30 34 23 34 31 25 30 25 33 28 32 33 34 29 \n67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 \n28 33 31 21 25 29 21 19 29 21 27  9 16 13 14 12 10  7  9  6  2  2  3  8 \n\n\n\nc(summary(ESS_NL$agea),cusmode(ESS_NL$agea))\n\n$Min.\n[1] 15\n\n$`1st Qu.`\n[1] 35\n\n$Median\n[1] 52\n\n$Mean\n[1] 50.52249\n\n$`3rd Qu.`\n[1] 66\n\n$Max.\n[1] 90\n\n$`NA's`\n[1] 5\n\n$`Mode(s)`\n[1] 52\n\n$Frequency\n[1] 38\n\n\nWhile this gives us everything we need, we might wish to have a neater looking summary table. dplyr can help us with that:\n\nESS_NL %&gt;% dplyr::summarize(\"N respondents\" = n(),\n                            \"Min. age\" = min(agea, na.rm = TRUE), \n                            \"Q1 age\" = quantile(agea, .25, na.rm = TRUE),\n                            \"Median age\" = median(agea, na.rm = TRUE),\n                            \"Q3 age\" = quantile(agea, .75, na.rm = TRUE),\n                            \"Max. age\" = max(agea, na.rm = TRUE),\n                            \"Mean age\" = mean(agea, na.rm = TRUE),\n                            \"Modal age\" = \n1                            paste(as.character(cusmode(agea)$`Mode(s)`), collapse = \" \")\n                            ) %&gt;% \n2  knitr::kable(align = \"c\")\n\n\n1\n\nThis line helps us create a single text string should we have multiple modes. as.character converts input to a text string, and the paste function with the added option collapse = \" \" folds the multiple modes into one text string separated by a space.\n\n2\n\nWe pass the output dataframe to knitr::kable to make our table neater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN respondents\nMin. age\nQ1 age\nMedian age\nQ3 age\nMax. age\nMean age\nModal age\n\n\n\n\n1695\n15\n35\n52\n66\n90\n50.52249\n52",

Rather, the principal aim is to build your comfort and confidence in using a small set of operations which will enable you to perform both confirmatory and exploratory statistical analyses with quantitative data typical of the social sciences, and to write a basic scientific document in which the outputs of those analyses can be embedded.\nIn chapters 1 - 4, we will introduce R and R Markdown, along with some very useful packages for data-wrangling and plotting. From there, chapters 5 - 11 will align with the Year 1 Introduction to Statistical Analysis course and will guide you through the tutorials. Chapters 12 - TBA will cover some more advanced statistical techniques and topics which are beyond the scope of ISA. While these have been written mainly with Politics and Psychology majors in mind, these may also be of interest to Economics or Law majors who would like to know more about analyzing (quantitative) experimental or survey data.\nOur hope is that this open book will remain in a fluid state, with updates and adjustments being made as analysis and programming methods evolve.",

    "text": "Questions you may have\n\nWhy am I learning R?\nWhile there are many excellent “click-and-point” statistical analysis packages available, it’s worth highlighting some of the benefits that come with using R and (R Markdown):\n\nYou can easily record and document all analysis steps (i.e., from raw data processing/wrangling, to inferential statistics and visualization) in a series of scripts, meaning that you don’t have to remember which sequence of buttons and drop down menus you followed to get to your analysis outputs. This facilitates complete reproducibility of your analysis pipeline and results.\nWriting your research papers and assignments with R Markdown means that all analysis outputs (e.g., descriptive statistics, test statistics, figures, tables, etc.) can be embedded without the need for pasting information from your statistics software into a separate word processor.\nYou gain more power to customize your analysis, rather than relying on the narrow range of defaults included in some statistical packages.\nIt’s free!\n\n\n\nRight, but I have zero experience in programming!\nWe hear you, but we think that you will be pleasantly surprised by how quickly you can get up and running. While this will be challenging, bear in mind that we are here to help, and we strongly believe that you are capable of doing very well, with a bit of application and effort.\n\n\nOK, but why am I learning R instead of, say, Python?\nThe main reasons for teaching this course in R are:\n\nIt is specialized for statistical computing and data visualization\n\nIt is very widely used by quantitative social scientists, meaning that accessible tutorials and answers to questions are often only a google away\nOur (informal) impression is that R has a relatively low bar for entry, when compared with more general-purpose languages like Python\n\n\n\nFor any other questions…\n… or, if you would simply like to provide some (very welcome) feedback on these materials, please get in touch.",

    "text": "6.4 Measures of dispersion\nIn this course, we will consider three measures of dispersion.\n\n6.4.1 The standard deviation\nThe standard deviation is defined as:\n\\[\nS = \\sqrt\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}\n\\]\nComputation of the standard deviation involves:\n\nCalculating the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\)\nSubtracting \\(\\bar{x}\\) from each “raw” value of \\(x\\) to compute deviations\nSquaring the deviations from step 2 \\((x_i - \\bar{x})^2\\)\nSumming the deviations \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\)\nDividing the deviations by the number of observations (\\(n\\)) minus 1\nTaking the square root of 5\n\nThe standard deviation can be roughly interpreted as the average deviation from the sample mean in the data. Much like the mean, this measure of dispersion is mot appropriate for interval/ratio level data.\n\n\n6.4.2 The range\nThe range is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data, and can be written as:\n\\[\nrange = max(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) - min(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\n\\]\n\n\n6.4.3 The interquartile range (IQR)\nThis represents the spread of the middle 50% of the data and is calculated as:\n\\[\nIQR = Q_3 - Q_1\n\\]\n\\(Q_3\\) and \\(Q_1\\), are, respectively, the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data.To find these for data \\(x\\) with \\(n\\) elements:\n\n\\(Q_1(x) = x_{(\\frac{n+1}{4})}\\)\n\\(Q_3(x) = x_{(\\frac{3(n+1)}{4})}\\)\n\nWhere the position index for the quartile is not a whole number, we can average the values from the two nearest whole number positions to find our quartile. For example, for data with \\(n = 100\\):\n\n\\(Q_1(x) = x_{(\\frac{101}{4})} = 25.25\\)\n\nIn the above case, we would average the 25th- and 26th-ranked values of \\(x\\) to find \\(Q_1(x)\\).",

    "text": "1.1.1 Layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: R Studio layout\n\n\n\nWith default settings, R Studio will resemble what you see in Figure 1.1. Let’s take a tour:\n\nThe blue highlight shows the editor window. This is where scripts containing multiple lines of code can be created and saved. This window only displays when you have an open script file, and will not be visible When you open R Studio for the very first time.\nThe green highlight shows the console, where code can be entered and executed. We can use this for testing small chunks of code, but we would not perform a whole analysis here.\nThe red highlight shows the environment (or workspace). This is empty in the image above, but will show variables when these are created or loaded.\nBy default, the yellow highlighted section will show the contents of your working directory (i.e., the directory from which your R session is currently running, and where any saved files will appear, unless you enter a new filepath). This can be toggled using the tabs at the top to show plots or help messages.\n\n\n\n1.1.2 General settings for reproducibility1\nBy default, R will give you prompts to save your workspace when you quit a session. To ensure reproducibility of your pipelines, you should always start a new session with a clear workspace, and you should never save your workspace when you exit. The only things you want to save are your scripts, which you will do manually. Before going further, set the following:\n\nTools &gt; Global Options\n\nGeneral &gt; uncheck the box Restore .RData into workspace at startup.\nSet “Save workspace to .RData on exit” to “Never”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Ensuring a clean start-up\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Creating a new R Project\nR Studio provides an environment where you can use R Markdown to create documents with embedded analysis outputs, and store these in self-contained project folders which will ensure that your analyses can easily be reproduced without having to change directory names when you switch computers. (See this link for more on the utility of using R projects.)\nTo open a new R project, click File &gt; NewProject. The ‘New Project Wizard’ will pop up, prompting you to specify where you would like to create your project. For now, the best choice would be one of the following:\n\nNew Directory. Create a completely new folder in which to base your project.\n\nExisting Directory. Name an already existing folder as your project base.\n\nAfter you have chosen your project folder, a project link will appear in that folder, which looks like this:\n\nClicking on it outside of R will open up a new R Studio session with your designated project folder as its starting directory. You can now move all data necessary for your project to this folder, where it can be easily found by R.\n\n\n1.1.4 Creating a new R script\nUsing scripts increases the transparency and reproducibility of your analyses. Every step in a pipeline can be documented, ensuring that you can see exactly which operations were performed (and at which stage in the process), and that you can re-run your analyses with consistent results.\nTo open a new R script, you can either hit Ctrl\\Cmd + Shift + n, or click File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. An editor window will spring open (as in the blue highlighted section in Figure 1.1) with a new, as yet untitled, .R file. Here, you can begin entering code, which can be saved for later (re-)use. A useful feature of scripts is the opportunity to leave comments for yourself and/or people with whom you will share the code. These are entered by typing hash (#) to the left of your comment, which tells R not to evaluate the comment as though it were code. See below for an example.\n\n# I'm leaving a comment on my code here. You can see that it appears in green, and all which does not appear in green will be evaluated by R.\n\nmy_variable &lt;- 2 + 2 # here, I am creating a variable called `my_variable` to which I am assigning the result of the sum 2 + 2.",
